For reproducing the Nvwa analysis from scratch, we recomand reading the `dmel.sh` in `main` folder, and downloading the drosophila dataset from the url below. 

## Datasets for eight species
We provided single cell labels for eight species in http://bis.zju.edu.cn/nvwa/dataset.html.

For the single cell labels, we provided the expression label, and corresponding cell, gene informations. The ready-to-use machine learning dataset were also publically accessed, which were paired with one-hot sequence, cell annotation information and split into train, validation, test set. The detailed preprocessing procedures were also described step by step.


## Running Nvwa
**Example**
```
python 1_train/1_hyperopt_BCE_best.py ./Dataset.Dmel_train_test.h5
python 1_train/1_hyperopt_BCE_best.py ./Dataset.Dmel_train_test.h5 --mode test
python 2_explain/1_run_explain.py ./Dataset.Dmel_train_test.h5
```
**Details**

`./Dataset.Dmel_train_test.h5`: example of Dataset.h5 file

`./1_train/1_hyperopt_BCE_best.py`: for init, train and test models

`--mode`: mode choice for train, test, test_all_gene

`2_explain/1_run_explain.py`: for explain models

`--help`: print help info.

## Note
Nvwa is now more like in-house scripts for reproducing our work, if you find any problem running Nvwa code, please contant me. If you run into errors loading trained model weights files, it is likely the result of differences in PyTorch or CUDA toolkit versions.  

NvTK (NvwaToolKit, https://github.com/JiaqiLiZju/NvTK), a more systemmatic software is under acitivate development. It will support modern deep learning achitectures in genomics, such as ResNet, Attention Module, and Transformer. I recommend to use NvTK for generating your own model.
